        The ancient Egyptians' language had archaeologists baffled until the hieroglyphs were carefully deciphered using the Rosetta Stone. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        How did Champollion decipher hieroglyphics?
Now Champollion turned to the title of Ptolemy found in the longer cartouches in the Rosetta Stone. Champollion knew the Coptic words that would translate the Greek text and could tell that phonetic hieroglyphs such as p and t would fit these words. From there he could guess the phonetic meanings of several more signs.

        Hieroglyphs are written in rows or columns and can be read from left to right or from right to left. You can distinguish the direction in which the text is to be read because the human or animal figures always face towards the beginning of the line. Also the upper symbols are read before the lower.
